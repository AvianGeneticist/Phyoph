# ANTI-MISSILE
# Overscaled compared to most, since it has to shoot down drones instead of conventional missiles. Comes in sniper and machine gun flavours.

	description "This is a very fast firing anti-missile designed to break apart microship swarms at close ranges. While each individual shot isn't very effective, the system fires extremely fast, blowing ships out of the sky with clockwork efficiency."

	description "While most species optimize for a balance between fire rate and per-shot effectiveness, with range generally being a happy accident in regards to anti-missiles, long-ranged attackers like the Issilthid mean the Phyoph need an effective deterrent to those at range."
	description "	While it takes a substantial amount of time to line up its shots, this anti-missile system boasts an extremely powerful pulse, delivering punishing blows even out to ranges past most species' conventional weapons."

# GENERATORS
# Pretty unimpressive generators; essentially Korath-tier Hai. They are smaller than most species', however, since the Phyoph rely more on batteries.

	description "Still reactors are highly efficient fission reactors designed to make the most out of their fission-based fuel. They run cooler than other types of reactors, but are not quite as powerful for the space they take up; a fact the Phyoph aren't bothered by, as their ships rely more on batteries to deal with surges of power use."

# REPAIR/BATTERIES
# Charged Armor that uses quite a bit of energy and heat, but acts as a battery.

	description "Phyoph ships rely on their shields to dampen enemy blows, but their hulls are what inevitably take the most punishment. Armor Chargers both provide power to localized hull repair measures and store excess for later use."

	description "Though Phyoph ships rarely have space for hull repair measures this big, some Phyoph Captains trade off capacity, speed, or firepower to make room to restore their hulls faster."

# COOLING
# Pretty typical hybrid cooling. Always consumes some energy, but is fairly efficient.

	description "The Phyoph aren't usually in dire need of extreme cooling, but they do make shipboard coolers for the event that such systems are necessary. This cooling system runs in a low power mode by default, but will increase its energy use to cool its host ship if things get too heated."

# ENGINES
# Reduced outfit space usage, but lower power per engine space as a result. The ultimate for people who want to tank.

	description "Compound Engines are generally quite small, but work in a way that puts a lot of stress on a ship's engine architecture. The result is that Compound Engines take up more engine space than they ought to; however, the Phyoph prefer to consider the effect a saving of outfit space instead."
